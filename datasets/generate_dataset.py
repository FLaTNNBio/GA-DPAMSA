DNA Sequence Dataset Generator

This script generates synthetic DNA sequence datasets with conserved blocks, mutations, and gaps. 
Users can configure various parameters such as sequence length, number of sequences, mutation rates, 
and whether to mutate inside conserved blocks. The generated datasets are stored in FASTA format, 
and a Python script is created to structure the dataset information.

Usage:
- Modify the configuration parameters in the script header to adjust dataset properties.
- Run the script to generate the datasets.

Output:
- A set of FASTA files containing the generated sequences.
    (Suited for tools benchmarking)
    
- A Python file with all the sets of generated sequences PLUS some metadata about the dataset itself.
    (Suited for both training and inference on DPAMSA and for GA-DPAMSA inference)
