Genetic Algorithm for DPAMSA Refinement (GA-DPAMSA)
---------------------------------------------------------
This module implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) used to refine multiple sequence 
alignments (MSA) as part of the GA-DPAMSA framework.
The GA evolves a population of candidate alignments through iterative processes including mutation, selection, 
and horizontal crossover. Evaluation of candidates is based on alignment quality 
metrics such as Sum-of-Pairs (SP) score and Column Score (CS), or a combination of both 
in Multi-Objective (MO) mode. A Hall of Fame is maintained to preserve the best alignment 
found across all generations.

Key Features:
    - Population Initialization: Generates an initial set of candidate alignments using 
      exact copies and modified copies (with random gap insertions).
    - Fitness Evaluation: Computes fitness scores using SP and/or CS metrics after cleaning 
      unnecessary gap columns.
    - Mutation: Applies an RL-based mutation to the worst-performing sub-region of selected 
      individuals.
    - Selection: Chooses top-performing individuals based on fitness scores (or Pareto front in MO mode).
    - Horizontal Crossover: Combines portions (rows) from two parent alignments to create new offspring.
    - Hall of Fame: Stores the best alignment encountered during the evolution process.

        Executes the complete Genetic Algorithm pipeline over multiple iterations.

        Process:
            1. Initialize the population.
            2. Calculate initial fitness scores.
            3. Validate that the RL model's window dimensions are compatible with the sequences.
            4. Iterate through GA steps:
                a. Apply mutation.
                b. Recalculate fitness scores.
                c. Perform selection.
                d. Execute horizontal crossover.
            5. Return the refined alignment from the best candidate in the Hall of Fame.

        Parameters:
        -----------
            model_path (str): Path to the RL model used for mutation.
            debug_mode (bool): If True, prints detailed log messages at each step.

        Returns:
        --------
            list: The nucleotide sequences (alignment) of the best candidate.
